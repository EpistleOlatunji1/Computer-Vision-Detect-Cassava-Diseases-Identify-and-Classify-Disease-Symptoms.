# Computer-Vision-Detect-Cassava-Diseases-Identify-and-Classify-Disease-Symptoms.
I developed a computer vision model to detect, identify, and classify cassava plant diseases using deep learning. The system analyzes leaf images to recognize disease symptoms, supporting early diagnosis, reducing crop loss, and improving agricultural productivity through data-driven decision making

assava Leaf Disease Detection using Deep Learning

## Problem
Cassava is a major food crop in Africa and Asia. Plant diseases significantly reduce yield and threaten food security. Early disease detection is critical for farmers to prevent crop loss.

## Objective
Develop a computer vision model that detects and classifies cassava leaf diseases from images to support early diagnosis and improve agricultural productivity.

## Dataset
Cassava leaf image dataset containing multiple disease categories including:
- Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD)
- Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)
- Bacterial Blight
- Green Mite Damage
- Healthy Leaves

## Methodology
A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on labeled cassava leaf images. Image preprocessing, augmentation, and transfer learning were applied to improve classification accuracy.

## Results
The model achieved high classification accuracy across disease categories and successfully identified disease symptoms from unseen images.

## Impact
This solution enables early disease diagnosis, reduces crop loss, and supports sustainable agriculture and food security.

## Tools
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
